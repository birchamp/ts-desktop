Instruction:
- After any multi-step request, complete and explicitly confirm each required step before proceeding to the next step.
- Do not advance to a later step until prior steps are done and confirmed.
- After receiving any new instruction from the user, check this `remember.md` file first.
- On each commit, review and update `devplan.md` so it reflects current status and confirms we are still on track.
